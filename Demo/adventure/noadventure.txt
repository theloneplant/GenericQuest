     You ignore the man calling you because you have better things to do. Clearly, the best option is to go back in the pub and get even more hammered. You walk into the pub.

     Your adventure ends here. You continue living the rest of your life uneventfully as the town drunk. Occasionally, you will perform bar tricks for travelers in exchange for drinks, which you use for sustenance.

Well played.
