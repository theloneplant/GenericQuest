     You ignore the man calling out to you because you have better things to do. Clearly, the best option is to go back in the pub and get even more hammered. You walk into the pub.

     Your adventure ends here. You never really accomplished anything throughout your life, you just lived life as the town drunk. Occasionally, you will perform bar tricks for people in exchange for drinks, which you use for sustenance.

Well played.
